# 🧱 Admin Dashboard (CSS Practice Project)

A fully responsive **admin dashboard UI** built with **HTML** and **CSS** [A little JS], designed to sharpen my layout and styling skills using **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**, and... a touch of darkness 🌙 (yes, there's a dark mode).

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge and The Odin Project curriculum.
